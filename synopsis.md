# Project Synopsis

The main goal of ClassCal is to create a web application with which the program directors of the RIT School of Film and Animation (SOFA) can schedule classes for upcoming semesters using a map of the buildings in which the school operates. Faculty will be able to view an interactive map showing which classrooms are reserved within a certain building for a given date and time. Any classrooms that can be scheduled during that time will be shown as open. From here, anyone with scheduling permissions can assign a class with specific meeting times to that classroom. Upon scheduling this class, the room will be shown as reserved for the classâ€™ meeting times. This will centralize the class scheduling process for SOFA, which will help mitigate communication errors, room scheduling conflicts, and any other headaches common with the current process.

The project currently has implemented logic for scheduling classes via an interactive map, but it is missing some key features that it will need for a proper release, like authentication. While previously SOFA has operated mostly in the Gannett building, the college will soon be holding classes in the newly constructed MAGIC Spell Studios (MSS), which was not accounted for in the previous iteration of the project. The goal of our team is to add both floors of MSS to the application and implement the missing functionality from the first release in order to allow SOFA to use the application to schedule classes.
